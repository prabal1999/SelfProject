    <h1 class="head">Introduction</h1>
    <p>You will be joining IIT Bombay in a few weeks/days, depending on when you read this, and we hope you are looking forward to it. As you spend these days preparing for this new life, there are bound to be lots of questions in your mind. Many of you might already know a few seniors and would have gotten your queries resolved, while others may not have contacts. To address all your queries, whether academic or otherwise, the Student Mentor Program has set up this website. We have addressed almost all the important questions in this website, but it might not cover them all.<br><br><br>In case you have any questions, you can comment via facebook on a relevant page and we will be happy to answer them!</p>
    <h2 class="head">The Must Haves - What to (NOT) get from home</h2>
    <p>This is probably the first time most of you will be moving away from home, and even for those who were away for coaching - this will be your first experience in setting up your rooms all by yourself. The rooms in campus are typically small in size and a little tight to accommodate, a fact that often shocks/scares parents, but then it encourages two things which will really benefit you in the long run :<br><br><br>1. Spending major chunks of time away from your room (except exam times :D)<br>2. Adjusting and all associated terms with your room-mate (who, as you will realize, might become one of the most important persons in your life) </p>
